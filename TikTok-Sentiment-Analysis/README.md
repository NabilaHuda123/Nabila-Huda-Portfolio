# 💬 Sentiment Analysis on TikTok App Reviews

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes user reviews of the **TikTok mobile app** to uncover public sentiment and major concerns. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, I classified user feedback into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments and visualized patterns in user experience and satisfaction.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NLTK, TextBlob, Matplotlib, WordCloud)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Power BI (for dashboard visualization)
- CSV review dataset

## 🧪 Techniques Applied
- Text cleaning (lowercasing, removing stopwords, punctuation)
- Sentiment scoring using TextBlob
- Word frequency analysis and word clouds
- Power BI dashboard integration (optional)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Majority of reviews were positive, appreciating the short-form content and creativity.
- Common negative feedback included ads, privacy concerns, and app crashes.
- "Addictive", "fun", and "easy" were among the top recurring positive keywords.
